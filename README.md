# covid-19-model-wc

R implementation of the WC govt COVID-19 forecast. 

Last updated 24 Apr 2020 - so probably out of date.

## Getting Started
### Execution
Open the [wc_model.R](./wc_model.R) script in RStudio and run!

Results will be stored in various output arrays, e.g. `total_cases`.

### Parameters
Model parameters are captured in the accompanying 
[wc_model_parameters.yaml](./wc_model_parameters.yaml) file.

The current values are all point values, but can be changed to distributions as
required.
